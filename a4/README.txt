Technical Notes:

- The eraser tool erases a region as mentionned in Piazza post @582
- There is a pan tool which allows users to pan and zoom without drawing on the screen.
  Users should use this tool when panning and zooming
- The undo and redo buttons can undo an unlimited number of actions
- The undo and redo will bring you to the page where the action was undone/redone
- Also, the app saves its data when the user switches activities and then restores the data when 
  the user comes back to the app
