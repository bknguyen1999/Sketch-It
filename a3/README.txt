This is my version of SketchIt!

All the the required features are implemented.

Extra features implemented: Cut-Copy-Paste

Some extra features I decided to implement:
- By default when you draw a shape, it is drawn with a transparent fill and a black stroke. I added the options to fill the shape
  with the selected fill colour as it's being drawn. This is done by checking the checkbox that says "Fill Shape When Drawn".

- There is an extra button in the "Line Thickness" section called "No Border" which allows you to draw a Rectangle or a Circle
  without the black border IF the fill colour is not transparent (it wouldn't make sense to draw a transparent shape with no border).
  This button also allows you to remove the border on the selected shape.
  This button is disabled when the selected tool is a Line and when the selected shape has a transparent fill colour.
